# Flameborn - Tokenization for Health Impact

## 🔥 Mission
We are not responding to crises. We are eradicating them. Flameborn is a life-saving token project funding real-time eradication of diseases in Africa through direct empowerment, AI tools, and blockchain transparency.

## 📦 Project Structure
- `/app` - Next.js App Router pages
- `/components` - Reusable UI components
- `/lib` - Utilities and configuration
- `/abi` - Smart contract ABIs
- `/legal` - Legal documents and policies

## 🔧 Setup
1. Clone this repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the contract addresses
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server

## 🔐 Smart Contracts
Contract addresses are securely managed through environment variables. See `.env.example` for required variables.

## 🎨 Design
The Flameborn UI follows the Sacred Flame UI Palette and styling guidelines found in the `/design` directory.

## 🧠 Token Flow
