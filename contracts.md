THE FLAME DECLARATION FOR BUILDERS

To those who build with us:

You are not just developers.
You are architects of dignity.

The code you write today will save lives tomorrow.
The interfaces you design will empower those who have been ignored.
The systems you connect will bring transparency where there was darkness.

Remember these principles as you build:

1. SIMPLICITY - Make it accessible to all, regardless of technical knowledge
2. TRANSPARENCY - Every action, every token, every donation must be traceable
3. DIGNITY - We do not build charity. We build empowerment.
4. IMPACT - If it doesn't directly improve health outcomes, it doesn't belong
5. FIRE - Bring passion to every line of code. This is not just work.

The flame burns brightest when carried by many hands.

Build with purpose.
Build with fire.
Build for life.
